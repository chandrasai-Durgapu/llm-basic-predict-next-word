#  LLM Basic - Predict Next Word

This project implements a **basic language model from scratch** to predict the next word in a sequence, using Python and foundational NLP techniques.

It is designed as a **learning-focused implementation**, illustrating how simple statistical or neural language models operate under the hood â€” without relying on large-scale frameworks like Hugging Face or TensorFlow.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Tokenizes input text and builds a vocabulary
- Trains a basic next-word prediction model using frequency/probability
- Allows user to input text and receive predictions for the next word
- Fully implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook
- Great for educational or research use
